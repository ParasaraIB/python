# Case Study
The case study is about simulating Empire State Building games. It's quite like a board game in which the gamers have to roll the dice 10 times (random step) and the end number generated by the 10th dice-roll is determining the next step of the player with the following rules:
1) if the dice shows the number of 1 and 2, the player has to move one step down.
2) if the dice shows the number of 3, 4, and 5, the player has to move one step up.
3) if the dice shows the number of 6, then the player have to re-roll the dice and the step to be taken is 6 plus the number that is shown by the subsequent dice-shaking.
To make a better representation of the real situation, let's say that the odds of falling down caused by clumsiness is 1.00%. After 500 times of simulation (random walk) Calculate the chance of getting 60 steps high or more!
*random walk is a series of random step.
